## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running. This is my updated portfolio after our second project in our Bootcamp class. I can't believe how much more I know going back to some of the early material! This site will be continously updated.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.
If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.
If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well. undefined

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Provide examples or screenshots to prove working.
